This is a small and simple program to calculate fibonacci numbers. It is
written in Haskell.

The main point to notice is the use of semi-explicit parallelism which
increases performance and makes it roughly n times as fast as a one-threaded
version (where n stands for the number of threads/CPUs available).

To try it out, simply type:

   make
   ./fibonacci n

where n stands for the 'n'th fibonacci number. The default number of threads is
set to 2, feel free to change the makefile appropriately.

Attention: I tried GHC 7.0.3 only and I don't know if any other compiler
supports this!
